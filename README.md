# Hi 👋, I'm Abdulsalam

**Full-Stack Developer | Python & JavaScript | Real-Time Systems Enthusiast**

I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys building **scalable backends**, **real-time applications**, and **clean, interactive user experiences**.  
I work comfortably across the stack — from APIs and databases to responsive frontends — and I love turning complex ideas into practical software.

## ✨ A Little More About Me

I started programming through game development and gradually transitioned into building full-stack applications.  
That journey taught me how to think logically, design systems thoughtfully, and write code that’s both functional and maintainable.

I enjoy learning, building, and refining — one project at a time.
